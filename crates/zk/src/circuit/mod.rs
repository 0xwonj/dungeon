//! Arkworks circuit proving backend (Phase 2+).
//!
//! This module implements hand-crafted circuits using Arkworks with explicit Merkle witness generation.
//! Uses Poseidon hash for Merkle trees and Groth16 for proof generation.
//! Provides better performance than zkVMs but requires more implementation effort.
//!
//! # Architecture (from docs/state-delta-architecture.md)
//!
//! ```text
//! StateDelta (bitmask)
//!   ↓
//! StateTransition (Merkle witnesses)
//!   ↓
//! Circuit (constraint system)
//!   ↓
//! Proof (compact, fast verification)
//! ```
//!
//! # Modules (to be implemented)
//!
//! - `merkle/`: Sparse Merkle tree implementation
//! - `witness/`: Witness generation from StateDelta
//! - `transition/`: StateTransition structure
//! - `circuits/`: Circuit definitions for each action type
//!
//! # Implementation Status
//!
//! **Not yet implemented** - This is Phase 2+ work that will be done when:
//! 1. zkVM proof generation time becomes a bottleneck
//! 2. On-chain verification costs are too high
//! 3. Team has bandwidth for multi-month circuit development
//!
//! For now, use the zkVM backend (default feature).
