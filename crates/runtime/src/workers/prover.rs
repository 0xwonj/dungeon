//! ZK proof generation worker.
//!
//! This worker subscribes to game events and generates zero-knowledge proofs
//! for executed actions. It maintains its own copy of the game state and
//! incremental Merkle trees (in Phase 4) to efficiently generate witnesses.
//!
//! Design principles:
//! - Completely isolated from game logic (only processes deltas)
//! - Runs asynchronously without blocking game execution
//! - Maintains its own copy of state + Merkle trees
//! - Emits proof events for clients/submitters to consume
