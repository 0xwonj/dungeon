/// Hook that activates/deactivates NPCs based on player proximity.
///
/// This hook implements the activation radius mechanic, ensuring only nearby
/// entities are scheduled for turns. This improves performance in large maps
/// and provides a natural "fog of war" effect.
///
/// # Behavior
///
/// When the player moves:
/// 1. NPCs within activation radius are added to the active set
/// 2. NPCs outside activation radius are removed from the active set
/// 3. Activated NPCs receive an initial ready_at based on Wait action cost
///
/// This hook runs at priority -10, after ActionCostHook but before most other hooks.
