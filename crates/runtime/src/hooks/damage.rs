//! Hook that reacts to entities taking damage and triggers follow-up effects.

use game_core::{Action, CharacterActionKind};

use super::{HookContext, HookCriticality, PostExecutionHook};

/// Entry hook for damage-related effect chains.
///
/// This hook does NOT apply damage (damage is already applied by AttackAction, etc.).
/// Instead, it detects when entities have taken damage and chains to follow-up hooks
/// like death checks, bleeding effects, damage reactions, etc.
///
/// # Role
///
/// DamageHook serves as the **entry point** for damage-related cascades:
/// - Detects damaged entities from the delta
/// - Chains to next hooks (death_check, bleeding, etc.) for each damaged entity
/// - Allows damage reactions to be modular and extensible
///
/// # Example Flow
///
/// ```text
/// Player attacks Goblin
///   → AttackAction executes and applies damage (HP -= 10)
///   → DamageHook detects damage in delta
///   → Chains to death_check (checks if HP <= 0)
///   → Chains to bleeding_check (checks if bleeding should apply)
///   → Chains to damage_reaction (on-hit effects)
/// ```
///
/// # Multiple Entities
///
/// When multiple entities take damage (AoE attacks, explosions), this hook
/// detects all of them and triggers follow-up chains accordingly.
