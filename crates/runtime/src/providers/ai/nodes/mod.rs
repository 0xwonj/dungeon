//! Game-specific behavior tree nodes.
//!
//! This module contains concrete implementations of behavior tree nodes
//! that use `game-core` types and logic. Nodes are divided into:
//!
//! - `conditions`: Nodes that check game state (return Success/Failure based on conditions)
//! - `actions`: Nodes that generate actions for entities to execute
