//! AI context for utility-based decision making.
//!
//! The [`AiContext`] serves as the "blackboard" for AI decision-making across
//! all three layers (Intent, Tactic, Action selection). It provides:
//!
//! - Read access to game state
//! - Cached available actions (computed once per turn)
//! - Helper methods for scoring functions
//! - Action storage mechanism

/// Context for AI decision-making across all three layers.
///
/// # Design
///
/// This struct provides all the information needed for utility scoring:
///
/// 1. **Game State**: Current world state (entity positions, HP, etc.)
/// 2. **Available Actions**: Pre-computed list of executable actions (cached)
/// 3. **Oracles**: Static game data (maps, items, NPC templates)
/// 4. **Action Storage**: Selected action to be executed
///
/// # Caching Strategy
///
/// `available_actions` is computed once per turn using `get_available_actions()`
/// and reused across all three decision layers. This avoids redundant computation
/// and ensures consistency.
///
/// # Lifetime
///
/// The `'a` lifetime ensures that the context doesn't outlive the `GameState`
/// it references. This is safe because AI evaluation happens synchronously
/// within a single turn.
