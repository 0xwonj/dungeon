# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Dungeon** is a deterministic, ZK-provable, turn-based 2D roguelike RPG built with Rust. The game demonstrates how zero-knowledge proofs enable **fairness without authority** and **secrecy without deceit** — every action, roll, and AI move can be cryptographically proven valid without revealing hidden information.

### Core Philosophy

- **Verifiable Computation**: ZK proofs ensure honest gameplay while preserving mystery (hidden maps, enemy intent, RNG seeds)
- **Systems Over Scripts**: Emergent gameplay from interacting systems (AI, factions, procedural generation) rather than authored narratives
- **Functional Core, Imperative Shell**: Pure deterministic logic in `game-core`, all I/O and side effects isolated in `runtime`
- **Off-chain Play, On-chain Trust**: Rich local gameplay with succinct proof verification for legitimacy

### Technical Architecture

**Multi-Backend ZK System**: Supports RISC0 zkVM (production) and stub prover (testing), with planned SP1/Arkworks support

**Three-Layer Design**:
1. **game-core**: Pure state machine with 3-phase action pipeline (pre_validate → apply → post_validate)
   - 5-layer stat system, oracle pattern, delta tracking, available actions query
2. **runtime**: Orchestration layer with workers, event bus, hooks, AI, and persistence
   - Topic-based events, utility AI (Intent → Tactic → Action), post-execution hooks
3. **client**: Multi-frontend architecture with shared UX primitives
   - Terminal UI with examine mode, cursor system, targeting

**Current Features**:
- ✅ Deterministic turn scheduling with entity activation
- ✅ Action system (Move, Attack, UseItem, Interact, Wait + system actions)
- ✅ Utility-based AI with trait composition (Species × Archetype × Faction × Temperament)
- ✅ State persistence (checkpoints, action logs, event logs, proof indices)
- ✅ CLI interface with examine panel and tactical targeting
- ✅ Oracle system for static content (maps, items, NPCs, loot tables)
- ✅ Stat system with unified bonus calculations
- 🚧 ZK proof generation (ProverWorker infrastructure in place)
- 📅 On-chain verification (planned)

**Development Status**: Early-stage prototype with active iteration on core gameplay systems. Architecture is stabilizing, but expect breaking changes as we refine the proof generation pipeline and blockchain integration.

## Build & Test Commands

**Recommended: Use Just command runner for multi-backend workflows**

Install Just: `cargo install just`

### Quick Start with Just

```bash
# Fast development (stub backend - instant, no real proofs)
just build stub
just run stub
just test stub

# Fast mode (no proof generation, no persistence)
just run-fast stub

# RISC0 backend (full production build with real proofs)
just build risc0
just run risc0

# Set default backend via environment variable
export ZK_BACKEND=stub
just build   # automatically uses stub
just run
just test

# See all available commands
just --list
just help
```

### Common Just Commands

- `just build [backend]` - Build workspace with specified backend
- `just run [backend]` - Run CLI client
- `just run-fast [backend]` - Run in fast mode (no proof generation, no persistence)
- `just test [backend]` - Run all tests
- `just lint [backend]` - Run clippy lints
- `just fmt` - Format all code
- `just check [backend]` - Run format check + lint + tests
- `just dev` - Fast development loop (format + lint + test with stub)
- `just pre-commit` - Pre-commit checks (recommended before committing)
- `just check-all` - Verify all backends compile
- `just tail-logs [session]` - Monitor client logs in real-time
- `just clean-data` - Clean save data and logs (with confirmation)

### Available ZK Backends

- `risc0` - RISC0 zkVM (production, real proofs, slow guest compilation)
- `stub` - Stub prover (instant, no real proofs, testing only)
- `sp1` - SP1 zkVM (not implemented yet)
- `arkworks` - Arkworks circuits (not implemented yet)

### Direct Cargo Commands (without Just)

If you prefer not to use Just, you can use cargo directly:

```bash
# Stub backend (fast development)
cargo build --workspace --no-default-features --features stub
cargo run -p client-cli --no-default-features --features stub
cargo test --workspace --no-default-features --features stub

# RISC0 backend (default)
cargo build --workspace
RISC0_SKIP_BUILD=1 cargo build --workspace  # skip guest builds

# Lint and format
cargo lint  # uses default backend (risc0)
cargo fmt --all
```

### Environment Variables

- `ZK_BACKEND` - Set default backend for Just commands (risc0, risc0-fast, stub, sp1, arkworks)
- `RISC0_SKIP_BUILD=1` - Skip guest builds during cargo build (use for fast iteration)
- `RISC0_DEV_MODE=1` - Fast dev proofs (when running with real RISC0 backend)
- `RUST_LOG=info` - Logging level (use `info` or `warn` only - `debug` causes RISC0 to pollute TUI output)

```

**Dependency flow**: `client`, `runtime`, `zk` → depend on `game/core` only. Never the reverse.

### game/core: Pure State Machine

- **Responsibility**: Deterministic rules engine, domain models, state management, and pure action execution
- **Architecture**: Three-phase action pipeline (pre_validate → apply → post_validate) with oracle-based environment
- **Core Modules**:
  - `action`: Action definitions and transitions (`Action`, `ActionTransition`, `CharacterActionKind`, `SystemActionKind`, `get_available_actions`)
  - `engine`: Action execution pipeline (`GameEngine::execute`, `ExecuteError`, actor validation, delta generation)
  - `state`: Canonical game state (`GameState`, `EntitiesState`, `WorldState`, `TurnState`, `StateDelta`)
  - `env`: Oracle trait definitions (`Env`, `GameEnv`, `MapOracle`, `ItemOracle`, `ActorOracle`, `TablesOracle`, `ConfigOracle`)
  - `stats`: Layered stat system (5 layers: Core → Derived → Speed → Modifiers → Resources with unified bonus calculation)
  - `config`: Game configuration (`GameConfig`)
- **Action System**:
  - Character actions: `Move`, `Attack`, `UseItem`, `Interact`, `Wait`
  - System actions: `PrepareTurn`, `ActionCost`, `Activation`
  - Actor validation: System actions from `EntityId::SYSTEM`, character actions from `state.turn.current_actor`
  - Available actions query: `get_available_actions(state, env, actor)` for AI and UI
- **State Management**:
  - Entity ID allocation with reserved IDs (0 = PLAYER, u32::MAX = SYSTEM)
  - Delta tracking: `StateDelta::from_states` captures all changes (skipped in zkvm mode)
  - Nonce increment after each successful execution
  - Tile view merging: static map + runtime occupancy
- **Stat System**:
  - 5-layer architecture (Core → Derived → Speed → Modifiers → Resources)
  - Unified bonus calculation: `Final = clamp((base + Flat) × (1 + %Inc/100) × More × Less, min, max)`
  - Trait-based design: `StatLayer` trait for Base → Bonuses → Final pattern
  - Snapshot consistency: All values locked at action initiation
- **Oracle Pattern**: Core reads oracles but never implements them (implementations live in runtime)
- **Constraints**: No I/O, no randomness, no floating point, no time/clocks, no crypto operations
- **Exports**: All public types re-exported through `lib.rs` (60+ types including actions, state, env, stats)

### runtime: Imperative Shell

- **Responsibility**: Orchestrates game loop, coordinates workers, manages persistence, implements oracles, and provides AI systems
- **Architecture**: Message-driven worker system with `tokio` channels, topic-based event bus, and flexible hook system
- **Core Modules**:
  - `api`: Public surface (`RuntimeHandle`, `ActionProvider`, `ProviderRegistry`, error types)
  - `runtime`: Runtime orchestrator with builder pattern (`Runtime`, `RuntimeBuilder`, config types)
  - `workers`: Background task coordination (`SimulationWorker`, `ProverWorker`, `PersistenceWorker`)
  - `events`: Topic-based event bus (`EventBus`, `Topic`, `GameStateEvent`, `ProofEvent`)
  - `hooks`: Post-execution hook system for runtime orchestration (`HookRegistry`, `PostExecutionHook`, `ActionCostHook`, `ActivationHook`)
  - `providers`: AI implementations (`UtilityAiProvider` with 3-layer utility scoring: Intent → Tactic → Action)
  - `oracle`: Oracle adapters (`OracleManager`, `MapOracleImpl`, `ActorOracleImpl`, `ItemOracleImpl`, `TablesOracleImpl`, `ConfigOracleImpl`)
  - `repository`: Persistence layer with trait-based storage (`StateRepository`, `CheckpointRepository`, `ActionLogReader`, `EventRepository` with file and in-memory implementations)
  - `scenario`: Entity placement and game initialization (`Scenario`, `EntityPlacement`, `EntityKind`)
- **Workers**: `SimulationWorker` (canonical state, action execution), `ProverWorker` (ZK proof generation), `PersistenceWorker` (state/event/proof persistence)
- **Event System**: Topic-based subscriptions (GameState, Proof, Turn topics) for efficient event routing
- **Hook System**: Post-execution hooks with priority ordering, chaining support, and criticality levels (Critical, Important, Optional)
- **AI System**: 3-layer utility-based AI (Intent → Tactic → Action) using TraitProfile composition (Species × Archetype × Faction × Temperament)

### client/core: Cross-Frontend Primitives

- **Crate name**: `client-core` (located at `crates/client/core/`)
- **Responsibility**: Shared UX glue for presenting the game across different frontend implementations
- **Modules**:
  - `event`: Event handling and consumption (`EventConsumer`, `EventImpact`)
  - `frontend`: Frontend abstraction layer (FrontendApp trait, message routing)
  - `message`: Message logging and formatting
  - `targeting`: Targeting system for tactical interactions
  - `view_model`: View models for rendering game state
- **Purpose**: Reusable presentation logic shared across CLI, GUI, and other frontend crates
- **Exports**: `EventConsumer`, `EventImpact`, frontend abstractions, view models

### client/bootstrap: Runtime Setup & Configuration

- **Crate name**: `client-bootstrap` (located at `crates/client/bootstrap/`)
- **Responsibility**: Bootstrap utilities for initializing runtime with proper configuration and oracles
- **Modules**:
  - `builder`: `RuntimeBuilder` builder pattern for assembling runtime with configuration
  - `config`: `CliConfig` and environment variable loading for client configuration
  - `oracles`: `OracleBundle`, `OracleFactory` trait, and `TestOracleFactory` implementation
- **Purpose**: Reusable setup code shared across CLI, UI, and other front-end crates
- **Exports**: `RuntimeBuilder`, `RuntimeSetup`, `CliConfig`, `OracleBundle`, `OracleFactory`

### client/cli: Terminal Interface

- **Crate name**: `client-cli` (located at `crates/client/cli/`)
- **Responsibility**: Async terminal application with cursor system, examine UI, and tactical interactions
- **Architecture**: Consumes `client-core` and `client-bootstrap`, subscribes to runtime events, renders state
- **Modules**:
  - `app`: Main application loop and state management
  - `cursor`: Cursor system for examine mode and targeting
  - `input`: User input handling and command parsing
  - `presentation`: Terminal rendering and UI components
- **Interaction**: Collects player commands, validates entity/turn alignment, forwards actions to runtime

## Code Organization Patterns

### Module Layout

- Use `mod.rs` for module re-exports or explicit module boundaries
- Export public API through crate root `lib.rs`
- NO inline unit tests in `#[cfg(test)]` modules - these slow down iteration and create maintenance overhead
- Integration tests only: Large-scale tests in `crates/<name>/tests/` directory that verify entire module behaviors

### Naming

- Functions/modules/files: `snake_case`
- Structs/enums/traits: `PascalCase`
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- 4-space indentation, trailing commas

### State & Actions

- All state mutations flow through the runtime's `SimulationWorker`, which delegates to `game/core`
- Actions are validated and executed deterministically within `game/core`
- Runtime emits `GameEvent` broadcasts for all state transitions (turn completion, action execution, failures)
- Clients consume events via `RuntimeHandle::subscribe_events()` for UI updates and feedback
- Turn scheduling is managed by the simulation worker via `prepare_next_turn()` calls

## Testing Policy

### Testing Philosophy

- **Temporary unit tests OK during development**: You may write small `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests to verify logic while actively developing
- **Delete after verification**: Once the feature works and is verified, DELETE all small unit tests from the same commit/PR
- **No committed unit tests**: Small `#[cfg(test)]` modules create maintenance overhead and slow iteration - never commit them
- **Integration tests only in main branch**: Focus on high-level module behavior in `crates/<name>/tests/` directories
- **Test when complete**: Write integration tests for stable features after development is done

### Test Guidelines

- Integration tests verify entire workflows (runtime orchestration, action execution pipelines, event flows)
- Name tests after complete behaviors: `test_movement_workflow()`, `test_turn_scheduling_pipeline()`
- Use in-memory repositories for runtime tests to avoid I/O overhead
- Always run `cargo test --workspace` before pushing to catch integration issues
- Capture critical regression scenarios as focused integration tests

### When to Write Tests

**During Development (Temporary):**
- ✅ Write small unit tests to verify your logic while coding
- ✅ Use `#[cfg(test)]` modules to check edge cases during implementation
- ⚠️ **MUST DELETE** these temporary tests before committing/pushing

**For Permanent Tests (Integration Only):**
- ✅ After feature development is complete and API is stable
- ✅ For complex multi-crate integration scenarios
- ✅ To document critical edge cases or regression scenarios

**Never Write Tests For:**
- ❌ Individual functions or small helper methods (in committed code)
- ❌ Obvious logic or trivial getters/setters
- ❌ Code that is still actively changing

### Development Workflow

1. **Write feature code** + temporary unit tests for verification
2. **Verify** the feature works with `cargo test`
3. **Delete** all temporary `#[cfg(test)]` unit test modules
4. **Optionally add** integration tests in `tests/` directory for critical workflows
5. **Commit** only the feature code (and integration tests if added)

## Commits

Use Conventional Commits format:
- `feat: add turn scheduling system`
- `fix: correct movement validation`
- `refactor: extract action command builder`
- `test: add movement edge cases`
- `docs: update runtime architecture`

Keep commits scoped to single concerns. Include doc updates when behavior changes.

## Important Design Boundaries

## Security & Determinism Notes

- All randomness and side-effects are injected at the edges (providers, repositories)
- `game/core` must remain pure and deterministic (no I/O, no floating point, no time/clocks)
- Runtime workers communicate via message passing to maintain isolation
- State transitions are reproducible given the same action sequence
- Future: Proof generation will validate action sequences without re-running full engine in-circuit
- Future: Blockchain integration will verify proofs on-chain with minimal gas costs
