> **Scope:** Tracks Dungeonâ€™s implementation progress, feature roadmap, and current technical priorities across engine, runtime, client, and proving layers.

---

This document tracks the current implementation status and roadmap for the Dungeon project. Unlike the architecture documentation, this file is updated frequently as features are completed.

## Current Implementation

### âœ… Core Engine & Runtime

- **Game Core Engine**: Pure deterministic state machine with no I/O or side effects
  - Three-phase action validation (pre-validate, execute, post-validate)
  - Comprehensive action types: Movement, Combat, Inventory, Interaction
  - State delta tracking for witness generation and event replay
  - Environment oracle system for content injection

- **Turn-Based Scheduling**: Deterministic turn management
  - Entity activation tracking with cooldown system
  - Turn preparation via `GameEngine::prepare_next_turn()`
  - Ready-at timestamps for action ordering

- **Runtime Orchestration**: Message-driven worker architecture
  - `SimulationWorker`: Manages canonical `GameState`, processes turns and actions
  - Event broadcasting via `tokio::broadcast` for fan-out consumption
  - `RuntimeHandle` API for client interaction
  - In-memory state repositories for testing

- **Event System**: Real-time game event notifications
  - `TurnCompleted`: New turn prepared with tick number
  - `ActionExecuted`: Successful actions with state deltas
  - `ActionFailed`: Validation/execution errors with context

### âœ… Client Infrastructure

- **Client Core**: Bootstrap and configuration layer
  - `CliConfig` for runtime parameters
  - Oracle factory system (`TestOracleFactory`)
  - Runtime initialization and lifecycle management

- **Frontend Abstraction**: `FrontendApp` trait in `client/frontend/core`
  - View model transformations
  - Message routing between UI and runtime
  - Event consumption patterns

- **CLI Terminal Interface**: Full-featured async application
  - **Examine Mode**: Press `E` to explore the map with cursor
    - WASD navigation to inspect tiles and entities
    - Detailed entity stats, items, and tile information display
  - **Cursor System**:
    - Manual cursor control in examine mode
    - Automatic targeting for combat (nearest enemy selection)
    - Target validation and range checking
  - **Action Input**: WASD movement, Space attack, inventory commands
  - **Real-time Updates**: Subscribes to runtime events for immediate feedback
  - **State Management**: Tracks UI modes, cursor position, player entity

### âœ… Content System

- **Static Content**: Maps, items, NPCs, loot tables in `game/content`
- **Oracle Implementations**: Adapters exposing content to game engine
  - `MapOracleImpl`: Terrain and map dimensions
  - `ItemOracleImpl`: Item definitions and categories
  - `NpcOracleImpl`: NPC templates and behaviors
  - `TablesOracleImpl`: Loot tables and drop rates
  - `ConfigOracleImpl`: Game configuration (cooldowns, ranges, damage)

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### High Priority

- [ ] Error handling consistency across crates
- [ ] Documentation coverage (API docs, examples)
- [ ] Test coverage for edge cases (especially action validation)

### Medium Priority

- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] Memory usage analysis (large state snapshots)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup (testing, linting, builds)
- [ ] Logging and tracing infrastructure

### Low Priority

- [ ] Code style consistency (some modules use different patterns)
- [ ] Dependency audit and minimization
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
